# 🧭 RouteFinder Visualizer

🚀 [Live Demo](https://routefinder07.netlify.app/) ; 

## 📌 Overview

**RouteFinder** is a lightweight, interactive web application that visually demonstrates how popular pathfinding algorithms work. Built with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, it allows users to create custom mazes and see real-time algorithm behavior in action—perfect for both learning and teaching algorithmic concepts.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Interactive Design
- Draw walls, and set start/end nodes easily.
- Build custom mazes or generate them randomly.

### 🧠 Algorithm Visualization
Visualize the working of:
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- A* (A-Star) Algorithm
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)

### ⚙️ Dynamic Customization
- Control visualization speed.
- Watch how algorithms handle obstacles and optimize paths.

### 📱 Responsive & Lightweight
- Optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers.
- No libraries or frameworks—just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Core Logic**: Pure JavaScript for algorithm execution and grid rendering

## 🧪 How to Use
